## Design Philosophy

Redistill is built on a simple principle: **performance first, opt-in durability**. By default, Redistill eliminates all disk I/O overhead to maximize throughput and minimize latency. When durability is required, both RDB snapshots and AOF (append-only file) are available as independent, opt-in features with configurable fsync policies.

### Core Principles

1. **Opt-in durability** - Zero disk I/O on the hot path by default. Users choose RDB, AOF, both, or neither.
2. **Multi-threaded** - Leverage all CPU cores
3. **Lock-free Reads** - Concurrent access without blocking
4. **Zero-copy** - Minimize memory allocations
5. **Graceful shutdown** - SIGTERM/SIGINT drain in-flight work and flush persistence before exit (Kubernetes-ready)
6. **Production-ready** - Security, monitoring, and reliability built-in

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Opt-in Durability Layer (RDB + AOF)

**What Redis Does:**
- AOF (Append-Only File) + RDB snapshots, both typically enabled
- `fsync()` calls on the hot path (configurable)

**What Redistill Does (Default):**
- No persistence by default. All data lives in memory only.
- Zero disk I/O overhead on the hot path. Hot path checks a single `OnceCell::get()` (a predictable-branch pointer load) to discover that AOF is disabled — no allocation, no lock.

**What Redistill Does (Opt-in):**

| Mode | What it provides | Hot-path cost when enabled |
|------|------------------|----------------------------|
| `persistence.enabled = true` (RDB) | Periodic snapshots via `BGSAVE`, snapshot-on-shutdown | Zero — background task only |
| `persistence.aof_enabled = true` + `aof_fsync = "no"` | Crash-survivable log, OS-flushed (~30s loss) | Negligible (~0% at P=1, ~20% at P=16+ from the append mutex) |
| `aof_fsync = "everysec"` (default when AOF on) | ≤1s loss, background fsync | Same as `no` |
| `aof_fsync = "always"` | Zero loss | ~550× slower — only for financial-grade needs |

**Both RDB and AOF can be enabled simultaneously.** On startup RDB is loaded first, then the AOF tail is replayed on top — matching Redis semantics.

**AOF rewrite (compaction):** The log is replaced periodically with a minimal `SET`/`HSET`-per-live-key serialization so it doesn't grow unboundedly. Triggered manually via `BGREWRITEAOF` or automatically when size crosses `aof_rewrite_percentage` × `last_rewrite_size`. Currently stop-the-world for the duration of the snapshot walk; concurrent rewrite is a future optimization.

**Implementation details:**
- RDB: bincode + atomic rename. See `src/persistence.rs`.
- AOF: `Mutex<BufWriter<File>>` + append-then-(maybe-fsync). RESP format. Replay dispatches through the same `execute_command` path as live traffic — one code path, one source of truth. See `src/aof.rs`.
- Both: background tasks (periodic snapshot, everysec fsync, rewrite supervisor) each take a `watch::Receiver<bool>` shutdown signal and exit cleanly on SIGTERM.

### 2. Multi-threaded Architecture

**What Redis Does:**
- Single-threaded event loop
- All commands processed sequentially
- Background threads only for slow operations (BGSAVE, etc.)

**What Redistill Does:**
- Tokio multi-threaded runtime
- Concurrent command processing across all cores
- Work-stealing scheduler for load balancing

**Impact:**
- Utilizes all CPU cores
- Higher throughput under load
- Better resource utilization
- Slightly higher memory overhead for thread pools

### 3. Lock-free Reads with DashMap

**What Redis Does:**
- Single thread = no locks needed
- Linear access to hash table

**What Redistill Does:**
- DashMap: Concurrent hash map with fine-grained locking
- Multiple shards (default 2048) for reduced contention
- Read operations don't block each other
- AHash for hardware-accelerated hashing (AES-NI instructions)

**Impact:**
- Concurrent GET operations scale linearly with cores
- Minimal contention on different keys
- Optimized for read-heavy workloads
- 2-4x faster hashing than traditional algorithms
- Slightly higher memory per shard

**Shard Count Impact:**
```
256 shards:   High contention, lower memory
2048 shards:  Optimal balance (Recommended)
4096 shards:  Maximum GET performance, higher memory
```

### 4. Zero-copy Design with Bytes

**What Redis Does:**
- String allocations for each value
- Memory copying on reads

**What Redistill Does:**
- Uses `Bytes` crate for reference-counted buffers
- Cheap cloning via reference counting
- No data copying on reads

**Impact:**
- Reduced memory allocations
- Faster reads (no memcpy)
- Lower GC pressure
- Better cache locality

### 5. Batched Writes

**What Redis Does:**
- Processes pipelined commands individually
- Atomic counters updated per operation

**What Redistill Does:**
- Batches operations internally
- Probabilistic LRU (90% skip rate)
- Batched counter updates (256x reduction in atomics)

**Impact:**
- Reduced atomic operation overhead
- Better CPU cache utilization
- Matches Redis performance at extreme concurrency
- LRU timestamps slightly less accurate (acceptable trade-off)

### 6. Async I/O with Tokio

**What Redis Does:**
- epoll/kqueue for event loop
- Custom networking code

**What Redistill Does:**
- Tokio for async networking
- Buffered I/O with per-connection async tasks

**Impact:**
- Battle-tested async runtime
- Efficient syscall management
- Better error handling
- Future-proof (Tokio improvements benefit Redistill)

### 7. Optional Snapshot Persistence

**What Redis Does:**
- AOF (Append-Only File) with fsync() calls
- RDB snapshots with fork() overhead
- Both enabled by default

**What Redistill Does:**
- **Default**: No persistence (zero overhead)
- **Optional**: Snapshot-based persistence (disabled by default)
  - Streaming serialization (constant memory)
  - Background saves (non-blocking)
  - Atomic file writes (temp file + rename)
  - Automatic loading on startup

**Impact:**
- **When disabled (default)**: Zero disk I/O, maximum performance
- **When enabled**: Warm restarts supported, zero impact on GET/SET hot path
- Background snapshots run in separate task, don't block requests
- Snapshot format: Binary (bincode) for fast serialization

**Configuration:**
```toml
[persistence]
enabled = false              # Default: OFF for max performance
snapshot_path = "redistill.rdb"
snapshot_interval = 300      # Auto-save every 5 minutes (0 = disabled)
save_on_shutdown = true      # Save on graceful shutdown
```

## Trade-offs

### What You Gain

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **4.5x faster throughput** | More requests per server |
| **5x lower latency (p50)** | Better user experience |
| **Read-heavy optimization** | Perfect for caching workloads |
| **Multi-core utilization** | Better hardware efficiency |
| **Lower infrastructure cost** | 50-83% cost savings vs alternatives |

**Important Note on Performance Claims:**
- Redistill is the **fastest single-instance** Redis-compatible server (9.07M ops/s per instance)
- Performance comparisons (4.5x vs Redis, 1.7x vs Dragonfly) are **single-instance** benchmarks
- Redis Cluster or Dragonfly with clustering can achieve higher **total throughput** by scaling horizontally across multiple instances
- However, **per-instance**, Redistill delivers the highest performance, meaning you need fewer instances to achieve the same throughput

### What You Lose

| Feature | Impact | Mitigation |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Persistence (default)** | Data lost on restart | Optional snapshot persistence available; use as cache, not source of truth |
| **Real-time Durability** | No AOF/write-ahead logging | Snapshot persistence for warm restarts (optional) |
| **Replication** | No built-in HA | Use client-side sharding/proxy |
| **Clustering** | No automatic sharding | Manual sharding or proxy |
| **Complex data types** | Only strings | Fine for 90% of cache use cases |
| **Modules** | No Redis modules | Built-in features cover most needs |

### When Redistill Excels

**Read-heavy workloads** (70%+ reads)
- GET operations are 2-4x faster than Redis
- Lock-free reads scale with cores

**High concurrency** (50-300 clients)
- Multi-threaded architecture shines
- Better resource utilization

**Pipelined workloads** (P≥16)
- Batched operations reduce overhead
- Optimized buffer management

**Medium-large values** (256B-10KB)
- Zero-copy design benefits larger values
- Less overhead relative to data size

### When Redis is Better

**Need real-time durability**
- Redis has AOF (write-ahead logging) for real-time durability
- Redistill has optional snapshots (warm restarts) but not real-time durability

**Need replication/clustering**
- Redis has built-in clustering (can scale to higher total throughput with multiple instances)
- Dragonfly supports clustering (can achieve higher aggregate throughput across cluster)
- Redistill requires manual sharding (no built-in clustering, but single-instance performance is highest)

**Complex data structures**
- Redis supports Lists, Sets, Hashes, Sorted Sets
- Redistill only supports strings (KV pairs)

**Write-heavy extreme loads** (>50% writes, 500+ clients)
- Redis's single-threaded model can be faster at extreme write concurrency
- Redistill's multi-threading has coordination overhead

## Use Cases

### Perfect For

**1. HTTP Session Storage**
- Read-heavy (sessions read on every request)
- Ephemeral data (can regenerate from auth service)
- High throughput requirements
- TTL support built-in

**2. API Response Caching**
- 95%+ cache hit rates typical
- Database queries 50-150ms vs cache 1-2ms
- Can regenerate from database
- Perfect for read-heavy workloads

**3. Rate Limiting**
- Simple counters with TTL
- High write throughput needed
- Loss of counter on restart acceptable
- Sub-millisecond latency required

**4. Real-time Leaderboards**
- Frequent reads, periodic writes
- Can rebuild from database
- Performance critical for UX
- TTL for automatic cleanup

**5. Feature Flags**
- Read-heavy (checked on every request)
- Small data size
- Occasional updates
- Low latency critical

### Not Recommended For

**1. Primary Data Store**
- Reason: No persistence
- Alternative: Use PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.

**2. Financial Transactions**
- Reason: Data loss on restart unacceptable
- Alternative: Use ACID-compliant database

**3. Long-term Data Storage**
- Reason: In-memory only, data evicted
- Alternative: Use database or object storage

**4. Complex Queries**
- Reason: No secondary indexes, no filtering
- Alternative: Use database with proper indexing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Concurrency Model

```rust
// Simplified architecture concept

// DashMap provides concurrent access
let store = DashMap::new();

// Read operations (lock-free)
async fn handle_get(key: &str) -> Option<Bytes> {
    store.get(key).map(|entry| entry.value().clone())
}

// Write operations (fine-grained locking)
async fn handle_set(key: String, value: Bytes) {
    store.insert(key, value);
}

// Multiple concurrent reads don't block each other
// Writes only lock the specific shard containing the key
```

### Memory Management

```
Key anatomy in memory:
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Key (Bytes)                            │  Variable (key length)
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Value (Bytes - reference counted)      │  Variable (value length)
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Timestamp (u32)                        │  4 bytes (AtomicU32)
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ TTL (Option<u64>)                      │  16 bytes
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ DashMap overhead                       │  ~32 bytes
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Entry struct overhead                  │  ~12 bytes
└────────────────────────────────────────┘

Fixed overhead per key: ~64 bytes
Total size: key_len + value_len + 64 bytes
```

### Eviction Strategy

**LRU (Least Recently Used):**
- Probabilistic updates (90% skip rate)
- On-demand eviction during write operations
- Configurable memory limit

**Algorithm:**
1. On SET operation, check if memory limit would be exceeded
2. If eviction needed, sample random shards (default: 5 samples)
3. From each shard, examine first entry (effectively random due to hash distribution)
4. Evict key with oldest `last_accessed` timestamp
5. Repeat until sufficient memory is freed
6. If no eviction policy set, reject write with OOM error

**Note:** Eviction is synchronous and happens during write operations, not in a background task. TTL expiration runs separately in a background task every 100ms.
