# Unit Tests Migration Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully moved all unit tests from `src/main.rs` to a separate test structure, keeping the main codebase clean and organized.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Library Interface (`src/lib.rs`)
- Extracted core data structures and functions into a library crate
- Exposed public API for testing: `ShardedStore`, `Entry`, `Config`, etc.
- Enables testing without running the full server

### 2. Moved Tests (`tests/unit_tests.rs`)
- **Removed** 530+ lines of test code from `main.rs`
- **Created** `tests/unit_tests.rs` with all 32 unit tests
- Tests now run as separate compilation unit

### 3. Test Coverage (32 Tests)
✅ **Storage Operations**: SET, GET, DELETE, EXISTS, KEYS
✅ **TTL/Expiration**: Basic TTL, edge cases, multiple keys with different TTLs
✅ **Concurrent Access**: Multi-threaded operations (10 threads × 100 ops)
✅ **Eviction Policies**: LRU, Random, NoEviction, zero-cost abstraction
✅ **Configuration**: Default values, security, memory limits
✅ **Helper Functions**: Case-insensitive comparison, size calculation, byte formatting
✅ **Edge Cases**: Empty keys, binary values, Unicode, 1MB values, 10K keys
✅ **Sharding**: Distribution verification across shards
✅ **Stress Tests**: 1000 key deletion, large datasets

### 4. Documentation Updated
- `tests/README.md`: Updated with new test structure
- `tests/unit/README.md`: Created guide for unit test organization
- Clear instructions for running and adding tests

## Project Structure

```
redistill/
├── src/
│   ├── main.rs          # Server binary (clean, no tests)
│   └── lib.rs           # Library for testing
├── tests/
│   ├── unit_tests.rs    # All 32 unit tests
│   ├── unit/            # Reserved for future test modules
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── integration/     # Integration tests (future)
│   ├── benchmarks/      # Performance benchmarks
│   └── scripts/         # Test utilities
└── Cargo.toml           # Build config (lib + bin)
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
cargo test

# Unit tests only
cargo test --test unit_tests

# Specific test
cargo test test_sharded_store_set_and_get

# Release mode (faster)
cargo test --release
```

## Test Results

```
running 32 tests
test result: ok. 32 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored
```

✅ All tests passing  
✅ Binary compiles successfully  
✅ Clean separation of concerns  
✅ Easy to add new tests  

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Main Code**: Removed 530+ lines of test code from `main.rs`
2. **Better Organization**: Tests in dedicated location (`tests/unit_tests.rs`)
3. **Faster Compilation**: Tests compile separately from binary
4. **Library API**: Can now be used as a dependency in other projects
5. **Professional Structure**: Follows Rust best practices

## Next Steps (Optional)

When tests grow larger, split `tests/unit_tests.rs` into modules:
- `tests/unit/store_tests.rs`
- `tests/unit/parser_tests.rs`
- `tests/unit/eviction_tests.rs`
- etc.

**Task Completed Successfully** ✅
